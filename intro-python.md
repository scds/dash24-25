# Intro to Python

This beginner-level workshop will introduce you to the basic concepts of the world’s most popular Python programming language. You’ll learn to store data in Python data types and variables, as well as learn how to perform operations on numbers and strings. No prior knowledge of Python is required. This session will be recorded and made available openly.

- McMaster participants (and the facilitator) will use their MAC ID to log in to [syzygy](https://mcmaster.syzygy.ca/), McMaster's Jupiter Notebook instance.
- Non-McMaster participants should be able to use [JupyterLite](https://jupyter.org/try-jupyter/lab/) for the exercises, though the interface and experience may differ slightly from the presentation.
