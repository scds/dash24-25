# Machine Learning with R: Random Forest Classification Approach

Join us for an **online workshop** on Random Forest, an ensemble machine-learning technique used for both classification and regression tasks. It is based on the concept of decision trees, where multiple decision trees are trained on different subsets of the data, and their predictions are combined to produce a more accurate and robust final prediction. Some applications of Random Forest Classification are in healthcare for diagnosing diseases based on patient data and in finance for detecting fraud by identifying unusual transaction patterns. It also finds applications in e-commerce for personalized recommendations and in environmental science for classifying land cover types from satellite imagery. 

Through this workshop, participants will learn how to build and interpret Random Forest models, understand feature importance, and apply this ensemble technique to improve prediction accuracy and handle complex datasets effectively.
