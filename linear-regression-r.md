# Linear regression using R

In this **online workshop**, we will explore how to use R for conducting linear regression analyses. Learning outcomes include:
- Fitting a linear model
- Interpreting coefficients
- Assessing model assumptions
- Evaluating the model's fit using diagnostic tools like residual plots.

**This workshop was not recorded. However, a previous year's recording and materials for this workshop can be found here: <https://learn.scds.ca/machine-learning-with-r/linear-regression.html>**

## Workshop Preparation
