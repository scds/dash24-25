# Machine Learning with R: K-Means Clustering 

This **online workshop** will cover K-Means Clustering, a powerful machine-learning technique used for data segmentation and pattern recognition. K-Means is the most common clustering technique for unsupervised Machine learning. Participants will gain a practical understanding of how to use K-means to group data points, interpret cluster results, and apply clustering techniques to real-world datasets for insights and decision-making.

**This workshop was not recorded. However, a previous year's recording and materials for this workshop can be found here: <https://learn.scds.ca/machine-learning-with-r/k-means.html>**

## Workshop Preparation 
An installed and working copy of R and R Studio is required on participants' laptops prior to the workshop. Follow instructions provided [here](http://www.rstudio.com/ide/download/desktop).
