This **in-person workshop** is designed for those who are curious about making maps but haven't yet had the opportunity to learn. It will provide a friendly introduction to geographic data and the mapping of this data using the geographic information system (GIS) software, [QGIS](https://qgis.org/). Absolutely no geography or quantitative background is necessary for an engaging experience. 

This workshop will provide attendees with the ability to describe geographic data and the basic capabilities of geographic information systems. By completeing the workshop exercise, attendees will become familiar with four basic components of the geographic information systems software, QGIS: (1) the QGIS graphical user interface, (2) geospatial webservices, (3) coordinate reference systerms, and (4) the QGIS print layout tool.
